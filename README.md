# pokego

A deliberately-poor Python wrapper for Go featuring Pokémon names and types as keywords in the language.

Created by Jannotta House for UChicago's 2020 Scav item #85:

> pokemon-go. No, DEFINITELY not Pokémon Go. pokemon-go: your programming language that is just a crappy wrapper for Go, where all the keywords are now Pokémon. It should be at least able to execute your equivalent of `go run`, but we wouldn’t object if it had more functionality.
